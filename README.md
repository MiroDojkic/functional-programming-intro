# Intro to functional programming
Examples used at DUMP internship lecture, demonstrating basic functional programming concepts.

## Running the examples
In order to run the functions defined in `Main.hs`, install the [cabal-install](https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal-Install) package.
After install, Cabal's package index might need an update:
```
cabal update
```

Examples can be tested in the Cabal REPL. To start it, run:
```
cabal repl
```

You can then invoke the loaded functions within the REPL.
For example:
```
sum [1..10]
```

To run the tests, call the following function within the Cabal REPL:
```
quickCheck prop_<test_name>
```
